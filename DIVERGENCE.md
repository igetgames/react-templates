## Differences from upstream [react-templates](https://github.com/wix/react-templates)

* [[PR]](igetgames/react-templates#1) Upgrade to React [v15.1.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v15.1.0)

Based off of this [pull request](nippur72/react-templates#5), and I also updated the react and react-dom versions in package.json.

* [[PR]](igetgames/react-templates#2) Update README.md for fork

I changed the Travis CI badge in README.md to point to my fork, to better test changes not present in upstream.
I also added this document to note all of my changes.
